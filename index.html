                                    <p>The Ladue High School Dads Club is a not for profit organization dating from the first year the high school opened its doors.</p>
                                    At the end of the 2014-2015 school year the club <strong><em>funded five individual student scholarships totaling</em> $9000</strong>. In addition to the scholarships, this past year the club <strong><em>provided $5,000 in academic, extra-curricular, and athletic student grants including the Laduette’s, the Speech and Debate Team, the Choir, and the Science Olympiad Team. <u>But not to Comp Sci Club</u></em></strong><br><br>
                                    Fundraisers in the past year included Football and other BBQs, as well as several online auctions.<br><br>
                                    Managed by a Executive Committee and Administration advisors. The organization’s mission is to financially support a broad array of academic, athletic, cultural and special event activities within the Ladue Horton Watkins Community that would otherwise go unfunded.<br><br>
                                    The Ladue Dads Club was formed in 1955, the first school year for Ladue Horton Watkins High School. An annual dance was sponsored for both parents and students to attend. In 1956, a Father-Son athletic banquet was started, and was quickly followed in 1957 with a Father-Daughter banquet. Many of St. Louis’ sports leaders have been guest speakers, such as Jack Buck, Lou Brock, Dan Kelly, Jay Randolph and Larry Wilson.<br><br>
                                    Since the early years, the Dads Club has often sponsored many special projects to help the school, such as the academic scholarships, purchase of athletic equipment & scoreboards, and various academic equipment.<br><br>
                                    Individual awards for student recognition has also been a long tradition for the Ladue Dads Club. The Dads Club Scholarship was established in the school’s third year until the present. It is the highest award given by the faculty to a graduating senior who best exemplifies the highest ideas of Ladue Horton Watkins High School. A picture of each of these students so honored is displayed in the front hallway of the school. Originally these students received $500 for college expenses and over the years this has been raised to $3,000.
